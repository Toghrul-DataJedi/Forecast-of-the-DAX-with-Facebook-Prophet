ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Toghrul!

ðŸš€ I'm passionate about data analytics and financial insights, and you've landed on my corner of the GitHub universe where I explore, experiment, and contribute to various data-driven projects.

ðŸ“Š I do anything with DATA!

ðŸ’¼ By day, I'm  a master student in economics at Friedrich Schiller University Jena(Germany), where I am improving myself in the Economics field.

ðŸ“« Let's connect! Whether you have questions about my projects or just want to chat about data, finance, or anything under the sun, feel free to reach out. 
I'm always open to collaboration and new opportunities 


ðŸŒŸ Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding!
